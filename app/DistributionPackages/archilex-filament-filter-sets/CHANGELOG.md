## v3.6.0 - 2024-01-24

### What's Changed

* Fix isRemovingAllFilters by @archilex in https://github.com/archilex/filament-filter-sets/pull/248

Filament v3.2 introduced a new deferFilters feature which updated some of the internal working of the code. I was able to work around them to support this new feature but also maintain compatibility up until 3.2.4 in which Filament updated an internal naming parameter to `$isRemovingAllFilters`. To support this I am tagging 3.6.0. If you need to stay on a lower version of Filament, then please set lock plugins version to 3.5.28 in your composer file.
